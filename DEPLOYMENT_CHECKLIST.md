## Common Issues & Solutions üêõ

### Issue: API Quota Exceeded Quickly

**Solution:**
- Increase cache TTL to 2-3 hours
- Reduce cron job frequency
- Upgrade to paid API tier

### Issue: Database Growing Too Fast

**Solution:**
- Run cleanup more frequently
- Reduce articles per category
- Archive old articles

### Issue: Slow Page Load

**Solution:**
- Check Network tab for slow requests
- Increase cache usage
- Optimize images
- Enable Vercel Edge Caching

### Issue: Cron Jobs Failing

**Solution:**
- Check Vercel logs
- Verify API key still valid
- Check database connection
- Verify endpoint URLs

## Emergency Rollback Plan üö®

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# Or redeploy specific version
vercel --prod --force
```

---

## Success Metrics üìä
