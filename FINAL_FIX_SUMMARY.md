### 2. ✅ All Code Uses Centralized Constant
- **106 references** to `NEWS_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER`
- **0 hardcoded** image paths
- All new articles use `/fallback.png`

### 3. ✅ Created Cache Clearing Tool

## 🔍 If You Still See Old Images

### Quick Diagnosis:
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
console.log('✅ Cache cleared');
location.reload();
```

### Database Check (Optional):
If you want to clean your Supabase database:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
-- See how many old records exist:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM news_articles 
WHERE image_url LIKE '%ttttttt%';

-- Update them (optional):
UPDATE news_articles 
SET image_url = '/fallback.png' 
WHERE image_url = '/ttttttt.jpg';

-- Or delete old articles:
DELETE FROM news_articles 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## ✨ How It Works Now

### Image Loading Flow:
```
1. API fetches news
   └─→ Has image URL? → Display it ✅
   └─→ No image URL? → Use NEWS_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER (/fallback.png) ✅

2. Image fails to load
   └─→ onError handler → Use NEWS_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER ✅

3. Old cached data with /ttttttt.jpg
   └─→ File exists → Shows your logo (we replaced it!) ✅
```

### Result:
- ✅ Professional appearance always
- ✅ Your logo displayed as fallback
- ✅ No broken image icons
- ✅ Branded experience throughout

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before:
- ❌ Unprofessional "ttttttt.jpg" filename
- ❌ Broken images when API fails
- ❌ Inconsistent fallback experience
- ❌ Hardcoded paths everywhere

### After:
- ✅ Professional logo as fallback
- ✅ Centralized constant (easy to change)
- ✅ Consistent branding
- ✅ No broken images ever
- ✅ Type-safe, maintainable code

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### To Change Fallback Image:
```bash
# Replace fallback.png with new image
cp new-logo.png public/fallback.png
cp new-logo.png public/ttttttt.jpg  # For old cached data

# Restart
npm start
```

### To Add Category-Specific Fallbacks (Future):
```typescript
// In src/constants/images.ts
export const FALLBACK_IMAGES = {
  default: '/fallback.png',
  technology: '/fallback-tech.png',
  sports: '/fallback-sports.png',
  business: '/fallback-business.png',
};

// Then use in components:
imageUrl: article.imageUrl || FALLBACK_IMAGES[category] || FALLBACK_IMAGES.default
```

---

## 📊 Verification Commands

### Check Code:
```bash
# Count constant usage
grep -r "NEWS_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
# Should show: 106+

# Check for hardcoded images
grep -r "ttttttt.jpg" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
# Should show: 0
```

### Check Files:
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls -lah public/fallback.png
ls -lah public/ttttttt.jpg

# They should be the same size (both your logo)
```

### Check Browser:
```javascript
// In console (F12):
Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(k => k.includes('watchman'))
  .forEach(k => console.log(k));

// Clear if needed:
localStorage.clear();
```
