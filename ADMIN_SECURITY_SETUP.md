## 🔑 Setting Admin Password

### Option 1: Use Environment Variable (RECOMMENDED)

**For Development:**
```bash
# Add to your .env file:
REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
```

**For Production (Vercel):**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add new variable:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - Value: `your-secure-password`
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Option 2: Change Default Password

The default password is currently: **`watchman2025`**

To change it:

**In `src/components/AdminAuth.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Line 13 - Change the default:
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = process.env.REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'your-new-password-here';
```

## 🚀 How to Access Admin Dashboard

### Step 1: Navigate to Admin URL
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```
or in production:
```
https://your-domain.com/admin
```

### Step 2: Enter Password
- Default: `watchman2025`
- Or: Your custom password from `.env`

### Step 3: Access Dashboard
- Session saved (until browser closes)
- Can logout anytime with "Logout" button

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
1. **Change the default password immediately**
2. **Use a strong password** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. **Store password in environment variable** (not in code)
4. **Use different passwords for dev/production**
5. **Share password securely** (password manager, not email/Slack)
6. **Logout when done** using the logout button

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't commit passwords to Git**
2. **Don't share password publicly**
3. **Don't use simple passwords** like "admin123"
4. **Don't leave admin session open** on shared computers
5. **Don't hardcode production password** in the code

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Security (Optional)

### Add IP Restriction (Vercel)
```javascript
// In vercel.json:
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/admin",
      "headers": {
        "X-Robots-Tag": "noindex, nofollow"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add Rate Limiting
Create `src/utils/rateLimit.ts`:
```typescript
const attempts = new Map<string, number>();

export const checkRateLimit = (ip: string): boolean => {
  const count = attempts.get(ip) || 0;
  if (count >= 5) {
    return false; // Too many attempts
  }
  attempts.set(ip, count + 1);
  return true;
};
```

### Add Two-Factor Authentication (Future)
Consider implementing:
- Email OTP
- SMS verification
- Authenticator app
- Hardware token

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Should see: Login screen with password field ✅
3. Should NOT see: Admin dashboard directly ❌
```

### Test 2: Wrong Password Blocked
```bash
1. Enter wrong password
2. Should see: Error message ✅
3. Should NOT access: Dashboard ❌
```

### Test 3: Correct Password Works
```bash
1. Enter correct password: watchman2025
2. Should see: Admin dashboard ✅
3. Should have: Full access to all features ✅
```

### Test 4: Logout Works
```bash
1. Click "Logout" button
2. Should return to: Login screen ✅
3. Should clear: Session storage ✅
```

### Test 5: Session Persists
```bash
1. Login successfully
2. Navigate away: http://localhost:3000/
3. Return to: http://localhost:3000/admin
4. Should still see: Dashboard (no re-login) ✅
```

### Test 6: Session Expires
```bash
1. Login successfully
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser
4. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin
5. Should see: Login screen again ✅

## 🚨 If You Get Locked Out

### Reset Method 1: Clear Browser Session
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
sessionStorage.removeItem('watchman_admin_auth');
location.reload();
```

### Reset Method 2: Change Password
```typescript
// In src/components/AdminAuth.tsx:
// Temporarily change line 13 to your new password
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'new-password-here';
```

### Reset Method 3: Bypass Authentication (Emergency)
```typescript
// In src/pages/Admin.tsx:
// Temporarily comment out authentication check:
/*
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return <AdminAuth onAuthenticated={handleAuthentication} />;
}
*/
```

**Remember to undo emergency changes after regaining access!**

- [ ] Added `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to `.env`
- [ ] Added same variable to Vercel environment
- [ ] Tested login works with new password
- [ ] Tested logout functionality
- [ ] Confirmed admin not in navigation
- [ ] Shared password securely with team

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Verified admin page requires password
- [ ] Confirmed wrong password is rejected
- [ ] Tested session persistence
- [ ] Tested session expires on browser close
- [ ] Checked admin URL not indexed by Google
- [ ] Team members can access with password

---

## 🔐 Recommended Passwords

### Development:
```
watchman2025 (current default - OK for dev)
```

### Staging:
```
Example: W@tchm@nSt@g1ng2025!
(Use a unique strong password)
```

### Production:
```
Example: Pr0d_W@tchm@n_S3cur3_2025!!#$
(Use a very strong unique password)
```

**Use a password generator for production!**

## 📱 Mobile Access

The admin dashboard is **fully responsive**:
- ✅ Works on tablets
- ✅ Works on phones
- ✅ Optimized touch interface
- ✅ Same security on all devices

---

## 🆘 Support

### Common Issues:

**Issue: Forgot password**
- Solution: Check `.env` file or Vercel environment variables
- Or: Change default in `AdminAuth.tsx`

**Issue: Login not working**
- Solution: Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Clear sessionStorage: `sessionStorage.clear()`
- Verify password matches exactly (case-sensitive!)

**Issue: Always shows login screen**
- Solution: Check sessionStorage is enabled in browser
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check browser extensions aren't blocking storage

**Issue: Session keeps expiring**
- Solution: This is normal behavior (browser close clears session)
- Keep browser window open while using admin
- Or: Implement localStorage for longer sessions (less secure)
