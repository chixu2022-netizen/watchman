# 🚀 Quick Start - Professional News Aggregator

## ✅ What We Just Built

Your app now works like **SmartNews, Google News, and Flipboard**!

- ✅ **3 smart cron jobs** pre-fetch news every 30min-2hours
- ✅ **Zero API calls** from users (all from database)
- ✅ **Instant page loads** (<1 second)
- ✅ **300 API calls/day** (predictable, controlled)

---

## 🏃 Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Commit & Push**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement professional news aggregator (SmartNews-style)"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
vercel --prod

# Or just push to GitHub (auto-deploys if connected)
```

### **Step 3: Wait 30 Minutes**

First cron job runs automatically at next 30-minute mark (e.g., 2:00, 2:30, 3:00).

## ✅ How to Verify It's Working

### **1. Check Cron Jobs (Vercel Dashboard)**

```
Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Cron Jobs

You should see 3 cron jobs:
✅ /api/cron-breaking-news (every 30 min)
✅ /api/cron-regular-news (every 1 hour)
✅ /api/cron-slow-news (every 2 hours)
```

### **2. Test Cron Manually**

```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron-breaking-news

# Should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "breaking_news",
  "articlesStored": 60,
  ...
}
```

### **3. Check Database (Supabase)**

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) 
FROM news_articles 
WHERE is_active = true 
GROUP BY category;

-- You should see articles!
```

### **4. Visit Your Site**

```
Open browser console (F12)
Visit homepage

You should see:
"📚 Homepage: Loading from database (no API calls)..."
"✅ Homepage loaded from database: world, crypto, technology..."
"🚀 Zero API calls made! All from pre-fetched data."

Page should load in <1 second!
```

## 📈 Cron Schedule

| Cron Job | Runs | Categories | Why |
|----------|------|------------|-----|
| **Breaking News** | Every 30 min | world, tech, crypto, business | Fast-moving news |
| **Regular News** | Every 1 hour | sports, entertainment, ai | Medium-speed news |
| **Slow News** | Every 2 hours | health, politics, local | Slow-moving news |

**Total:** ~300 API calls/day (well under your 500/day limit!)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"No articles in database"**

Wait for first cron run (every 30 min at :00 or :30).

Or manually trigger:
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron-breaking-news
```

### **"Page is slow"**

First visit might query empty database. After first cron run, should be instant!

### **"Cron jobs not running"**

Check Vercel dashboard → Functions → Cron Jobs → Logs

Make sure `vercel.json` is deployed.
